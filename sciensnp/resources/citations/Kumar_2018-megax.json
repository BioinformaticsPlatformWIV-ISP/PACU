  "abstract": "The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software implements many analytical methods and tools for phylogenomics and phylomedicine. Here, we report a transformation of MEGA to enable cross-platform use on Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems. MEGA X does not require virtualization or emulation software and provides a uniform user experience across platforms. MEGA X has additionally been upgraded to use multiple computing cores for many molecular evolutionary analyses. MEGA X is available in two interfaces (graphical and command line) and can be downloaded from www.megasoftware.net free of charge."
